# Web Audio Modular Synth
[Live Demo](https://smilebags.github.io/web-audio-synth/dist/index.html)

This is a pet project involving the web audio API and canvas 2d rendering. It is heavily inspired by eurorack modular synthesizer components and uses the conventions found there for communication between modules.

NOTE: It only runs in Chrome currently due to [AudioWorklet API support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_audioworklet).
