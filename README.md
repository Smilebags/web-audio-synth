# Web Audio Modular Synth
This is a pet project involving the web audio API and canvas 2d rendering. It is heavily inspired by eurorack modular synthesizer components and uses the conventions found there for communication between modules.
## TODO
- Add cables to save and load functionality
- Add mixer
- Add sample player
